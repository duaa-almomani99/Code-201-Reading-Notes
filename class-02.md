CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector(Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas. ) and a declaration.(Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.)


CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property (Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border )and a value(  Values specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.
), separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
