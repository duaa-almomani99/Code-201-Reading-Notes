prosses and design
when you are going to create your own website you should be aware to some points , here i will mention some of them ü§ì
* whos the site for .... Every website should be designed for the target audience‚Äînot just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience
* (inDiviDuals) ‚óè What is the age range of your target audience? ‚óè Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix? ‚óè Which country do your visitors live in? ‚óè Do they live in urban or rural areas? ‚óè What is the average income of visitors? ‚óè What level of education do they have? ‚óè What is their marital or family status? ‚óè What is their occupation? ‚óè How many hours do they work per week? ‚óè How often do they use the web? ‚óè What kind of device do they use to access the web?
* (comPanies) ‚óè What is the size of the company or relevant department? ‚óè What is the position of people in the company who visit your site? ‚óè Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else? ‚óè How large is the budget they control?
* Why PeoPle visit your Website when you know the people who are visiting your website now you should know why there are people visiting your website and why there people will acrossing you website .... To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask: 1: The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site. 2: The second examines the specific goals of the visitors.
* What your visitors are trying to achieve It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site design ....
* you will try to creat alist and miniptioning why people will try to get in to your website then you can assign the list of tasks to the fictional visitors that you created in the step described on the previous page structure structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen is in black.





Evolution of htMl

Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML

htMl 4
rElEasEd 1997
With the exception of a few elements added in HTML5 (which have been highlighted), the elements you have seen in this book were all available in HTML 4.
Although HTML 4 had some presentational elements to control the appearance of pages, authors are not recommended to use them any more. (Examples include the <center> element for centering content on a
page, <font> for controlling the appearance of text, and <strike> to put a line through the text ‚Äî all of these can be achieved with CSS instead.)

xhtMl 1.0
rElEasEd 2000
In 1998, a language called XML was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write new markup languages. Since HTML was the most widely used markup language around, it was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed XHTML. This meant that authors had to follow some new, more strict rules about writing markup. 


htMl5
rElEasEd 2000
In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but
the major browser makers had started to implement many of the new features, and web page authors were rapidly adopting the new markup.
Despite the fact that HTML5
is not yet completed, you can safely take advantage of the new features of the language as long as you endeavour to ensure that users with older browsers will be able to view your pages (even though some of the extra features will not be visible to them 
....
Doctypes
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using 



... <!-- -->
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
<!-- comment goes here --

id attributE
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page
have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).



HTML5 LayouT


new HTML5 LayouT element

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already. 


* navaigraTTicioLne
<nav>
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation

* arTicLes
* <article>The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

* Heading garToiucpLes 
* <hgroup>The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
